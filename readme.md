# `revanced_chats` by [jpa102](https://github.com/jpa102)

important disclaimer: the **real** `revanced-discussions` is located at https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-discussions, which links to their organization page. please do not confuse this with my own variant which is`revanced_chats`

***

ah yes, a repository where i can place [issues](https://github.com/jpa102/revanced_chats/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/jpa102/revanced_chats/discussions)

backstory: i originally created this when i'm not too sure to submit it to `ReVanced/revanced-patches` repository, hence the name. now it's way different than that

this can contain issues / discussions about the original revanced and revanced extended variants (i use [original](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches) and [inotia00 patches](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches) myself)
