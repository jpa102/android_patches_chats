# `android_patches_chats` by [jpa102](https://github.com/jpa102)

ah yes, a repository where i can place [issues](https://github.com/jpa102/android_patches_chats/issues) or [discussions](https://github.com/jpa102/android_patches_chats/discussions). no reaching out to my private dms needed as valuable tech info should be made public, not stored away from a space where you have to log in like discord or telegram

backstory: i originally created this when i wasn't too sure to submit issues to `ReVanced/revanced-patches` repository, hence the name. now it's way different than that

this can contain issues / discussions about stuff like revanced, revanced extended variants, and morphe (i use [revanced](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-patches), [inotia00 patches](https://github.com/inotia00/revanced-patches), and [morphe patches](https://github.com/MorpheApp/morphe-patches) myself)

<sup>*any space can be a forum if one is ignorant enough*</sup>

<sup>disclaimer: i only have very little experience in android development so i'm not the right person to be asked about precise technical details in android patches like revanced</sup>
